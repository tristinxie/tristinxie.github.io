1. [ACM Teammate Finder](https://github.com/LelandTLong/ACM_Project)

    - Here is a snippet of a main component that I worked on:

    ```
    const createOwnerEvent = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
            if (user) {
                // A user is signed in.
                console.log(user) 
                const data = {
                    creator_id: user.uid,
                    description: description,
                    end_date: endDate,
                    max_applicants: maxApplicants,
                    status: true,
                    title: title,
                    type: type.toUpperCase()
                }
                const response = fetch(`/events/create/${user.uid}`, {
                    method: 'POST',
                    body: JSON.stringify(data),
                    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
                })
                setOpenSubmitDialog(true);
                return response.json;
            } else {
                // No user is signed in.
                console.log('There is no logged in user');
                history.push('/');
            }
        });
    }
    ```

I like to program in many programming languages, including C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and more! One of my favorite phrases is:
> Do you like to code?

because yes I do and I hope you do too!
